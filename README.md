# Building a Clean Architecture Flutter App with OMDB API and Provider State Management

In this example, we're creating a Flutter application following the principles of clean architecture. The application will interact with the OMDB API to fetch movie search results, and we'll manage the state using the Provider package.

# Project Structure:
We've organized the project into distinct layers to adhere to clean architecture principles:

```
/lib
|-- core
    |-- connection: Contains code related to connection management.
    |-- params
        |-- errors: Definitions for error handling.
        |-- params: Additional parameters and configurations.
|-- feature
    |-- feature1
        |-- business: Logic specific to 'feature1'.
            |-- entities: Definitions of core business entities.
            |-- usecase: Implementation of use cases or business logic.
            |-- repository: Interfaces or abstract classes for data access.
        |-- data: Data-related concerns for 'feature1'.
            |-- model: Data models or DTOs (Data Transfer Objects).
            |-- datasource: Classes responsible for fetching data.
            |-- repository: Concrete implementations of data repositories.
        |-- presentation: UI and user interaction for 'feature1'.
            |-- page: Flutter pages or screens.
            |-- provider: State management providers.
            |-- widget: Reusable UI components.
